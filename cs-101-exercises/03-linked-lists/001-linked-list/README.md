#### Programs

**Keywords:**
+ Lists, Stacks, Queues
+ Linked lists


##### IntArrayBackedLinkedList
Implementation of a Linked List backed by an array.
			
##### DynamicLinkedList
A linked list implementation backed by dynamic memory.

##### CircularDynamicLinkedList
A variation of linked list that is circular: the last node points to the first one.

##### DoubleLinkedList
A variation of linked list in which the node contains pointers to the next and prev elements.

##### SortedDynamicLinkedList
A variation of linked list in which the elements are placed in the established order.

##### ListCopy
A program that copies a list into another one.

##### DynamicLinkedQueue
Implementation of a Queue using the linked list as the underlying structure.

##### CircularDynamicLinkedQueue
Implementation of a Circular Queue using the linked list as the underlying structure.

##### DynamicLinkedStack
Implementation of a Stack using the linked list as the underlying structure.
